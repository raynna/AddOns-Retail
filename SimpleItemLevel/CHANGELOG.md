[Full Changelog](https://github.com/kemayo/wow-simpleitemlevel/compare/v41.3...v42) [Previous Releases](https://github.com/kemayo/wow-simpleitemlevel/releases)

- Itemlevels in scaled loot were off because the API itemlink is wrong  
    Fall back on tooltip scanning. Will only work on weapons/armor... but  
    conveniently, that's what gets scaled.
